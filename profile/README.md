Think Company is a research, design, and development organization with an office in Philadelphia, PA, USA, and developers all over the country.

We love beatiful, performant front end code.  We believe that accessibility is fundamental.  We enjoy working with each other, and we work hard to collaborate both with designers and other developers in order to make new things in a respectful, fair, and low-stress way.

Here's a couple of things to look at that represent what we do here!

* [ui.thinkcompany.dev](https://ui.thinkcompany.dev/?path=/story/storybook-welcome--page): This is the Storybook pattern library for our own website.  
* [standards.thinkcompany.dev](https://standards.thinkcompany.dev): This is our internal coding-standards repository.  Like many coding-standards repositories, it could use improvement.  Want to suggest an improvement? Let us know!
